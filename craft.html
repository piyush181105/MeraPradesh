                <h2>Craft of Uttar Pradesh </h2>
                <p>
                    The craftsmanship of Uttar Pradesh is a vibrant testament to its rich cultural and historical
                    legacy, with artisanal skills passed down through generations. The state is a treasure trove of
                    exquisite artistry, globally renowned for the delicate white-on-white Chikankari embroidery of
                    Lucknow and the opulent Banarasi silk sarees from Varanasi, intricately woven with gold and silver
                    zari.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city of Moradabad shines as 'Pital Nagri' (the Brass City) for its ornate brassware, while Agra
                    preserves the delicate Mughal art of marble inlay work. From the intricate Zardozi metal embroidery
                    found in cities like Bareilly and Lucknow to the hand-knotted carpets of Bhadohi, each craft is a
                    piece of living history that reflects the soul of the region.

                <h2>Textile Traditions: Weaving and Embroidery</h2>
                <p>
                    Uttar Pradesh is a treasure trove of textile arts, renowned globally for its exquisite fabrics and
                    needlework. Varanasi is the heart of silk weaving, producing the world-famous Banarasi sarees, which
                    are cherished for their opulent silk, intricate designs, and gold or silver brocade (zari) work. In
                    contrast, Lucknow, the state's capital, is celebrated for Chikankari, a delicate and elegant form of
                    white-on-white floral embroidery. This subtle craft, traditionally done on fine muslin cloth, is a
                    symbol of grace and sophistication.

                <h2>Stone and Clay Artistry</h2>
                <p>
                    The state's legacy in stone and clay crafts is monumental. Agra, home to the Taj Mahal, is the
                    epicenter of marble inlay work, known as Pietra Dura. Artisans here skillfully embed semi-precious
                    stones into marble to create stunning floral and geometric patterns on tabletops, boxes, and
                    decorative items. Not far away, the town of Khurja is famous for its vibrant and distinctive glazed
                    pottery. This craft produces a wide range of ceramic items, from everyday tableware to decorative
                    pots, known for their colorful hand-painted designs.

                <p>
                    Uttar Pradesh has a long-standing tradition of masterful metal and woodwork. Moradabad is famously
                    known as the "Brass City" (Pital Nagri) and is one of the world's largest exporters of brassware.
                    Artisans here create a vast array of items, from utensils and lamps to intricate decorative pieces,
                    often featuring detailed engravings. Similarly, Saharanpur is a major hub for wood carving. The city
                    is renowned for its ornate furniture and decorative items made from woods like Sheesham and Teak,
                    showcasing complex carving skills passed down through generations.
